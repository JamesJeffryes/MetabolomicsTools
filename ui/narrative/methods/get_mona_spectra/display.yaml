            Metabolic Model
        short-hint : |
            The metabolic model with which to filter the spectral library
    spectra_source :

            Spectra Source
        short-hint : |
            The spectra type to pull
    spectra_query :
        ui-name : |
            Spectra Source Query
        short-hint : |
            A query applied to the spectra source to limit the size of the library a priori.
            Only functionaly with MONA API option.
            For example, 'compound.metaData=q=name=="molecular formula" and value=="C47H74O12S"'
            would limit the query to only return compounds with a formula of C47H74O12S.

    <p>Public Mass Spectra Libraries are a great resource to help annoatate
    metabolomics data and quantify the concentrations of small molicules in the
    cell and in the media. However, just like general chemistry databases, these
    libraries contain many more compounds than are relivant for a particular
    experiment and species. This tool pulls from the largest free mass spectrum
    repository, the Mass Bank of North America and filters this library to produce
    a subset which contains only spectra which match the chemical structure or
    name of a compound in a metabolic model.</p>
