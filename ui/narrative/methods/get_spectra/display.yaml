        ui-name : |
            Metabolic Model
        short-hint : |
            The Metabolic Model to use as a template
    spectra_source :
        ui-name : |
            Spectra Source
        short-hint : |
            The database to pull spectra from, currently the only options are MONA databases
    spectra_query :
        ui-name : |
            Spectra Source Query
        short-hint : |
            A query applied to the spectra source to limit the size of the library a priori.
            For example, 'compound.metaData=q=name=="molecular formula" and value=="C47H74O12S"'
            would limit the query to only return compounds with a formula of C47H74O12S.
